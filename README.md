This is the repro for Round 4.

Currently round 4 is a Mendel90 frame with a build volume of 200x200x200mm

But we have put our own twist's on it:

- All wires are run on top side of the base plate
- The endstop is a minimum endstop and not a maximum one
- The X carriage can be both the standard one or the one used on a Prusa I3
- The sheets can be used by both new builders and the ones that has a Round1-3 printer
- Builder has option to use either a 12V 30A type PSU or an ATX PSU
- The sheet also have holes for an optional enclosure found on thingiverse here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:755654 and here http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:744868

The reasons for this are:

- Wires run on the underside tends to get caught to easy and flop arround. And we can loose the alu tubes which again have very hard to print/use endcaps.
- Max mounted endstops have its advantages but you have to home up with them and hence you have to go all the way down again before you can print. 
- Providing build guide info for both gives the builder a chioce. Prusa I3 has the benefit that a lot more things have been created for it
- We aim to be able to provide a set of sheets which can suit both upgrades and new builds
- Giving the choice of PSU let's the builder choose free. ATX's needs to be modded to work right (need to dummy loads added)
- An enclosure is almost a MUST HAVE if you want to print in ABS and have good results. This is optional thou but the holes for it will be on the sheets

 
 The BOM is here, it might need some tweaks so it can change as we get closer: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C7syP7WIMzRRcczZF0KAYDTLpP77kqbQEB_rWFmMJsc/edit?usp=sharing

 
 CURRENT STATUS: Verifying printed parts
 ---------------------------------------

We want to test that all the printed parts come out right on a calibrated printer.
