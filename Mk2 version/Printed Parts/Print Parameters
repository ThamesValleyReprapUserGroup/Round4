Print Parameters

So far the parts have only been tested in ABS.

Nophead prints the gears, pulleys and cable clips with a 0.35mm nozzle using 0.3mm layers. 
All the other parts are printed with a 0.4mm nozzle and 0.4mm layers.

The recommended infill density settings are as follows: -

Fixing blocks, Wades block, Wades idler block, Wades small gear	95%
Y bearing mounts, Z couplings	75%
Z motor brackets	75% hex
Bar clamps, Y belt anchors, Y idler bracket	50%
X carriage, Y motor bracket	50% hex
X idler bracket, X motor bracket	25% hex
Everything else	25%

Printed with these setting the parts weigh about 400g, a little less than a Prusa.

Most of the holes are polyholes, so they should come out the right size on a well calibrated printer.
